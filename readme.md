gDork is a python script that automates Google Dorks (Also known as Google Hacking).

To use this tool, you will need both Selenium and "chromedrivers", since it uses Google Chrome to make the dork search.

pip install selenium
download chromedrivers, paste the contents of the zip file into "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe", or simply modify the path on the python code.
